# express-starter

1. The element I decided to add to my html response was the alt tag that is often used to describe
images if it can't be seen by the user. The link that I used to demonstrate this is the iSchool
website: https://ischool.uw.edu/

2. The visual layout that I changed for the assignment is that I made everything larger: for instance,
the area where you can enter the url is now longer and the response html is a large card that 
is easy to view. I made this change because I felt that it was difficult to see the text before,
but it is much easier to see now.
